function output = my_imfilter(image, filter)
% This function is intended to behave like the built in function imfilter()
% when operating in convolution mode. See 'help imfilter'. 
% While "correlation" and "convolution" are both called filtering, 
% there is a difference. From 'help filter2':
%    2-D correlation is related to 2-D convolution by a 180 degree rotation
%    of the filter matrix.

% Your function should meet the requirements laid out on the project webpage.

% Boundary handling can be tricky as the filter can't be centered on pixels
% at the image boundary without parts of the filter being out of bounds. If
% we look at 'help imfilter', we see that there are several options to deal 
% with boundaries. 
% Please recreate the default behavior of imfilter:
% to pad the input image with zeros, and return a filtered image which matches 
% the input image resolution. 
% A better approach is to mirror or reflect the image content in the padding.

% Uncomment to call imfilter to see the desired behavior.
% output = imfilter(image, filter, 'conv');
