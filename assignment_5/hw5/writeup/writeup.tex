\textbf{[NOTE]} \\
I wrote my code under assumption that it is tested in \textbf{MATLAB 2019b}. If it is run in lower versions, it may cause errors. Please test it in 2019b.

\section*{Implementation}

\textbf{Representation - Tiny images} \\
I made tiny image representation by applying below code to each double image.
\begin{lstlisting}
% To tiny img.
img = imresize(img, [16, 16]);
img = reshape(img, [1, 16 * 16]);

% zero mean and unit length.
img = img - mean(img);
img = img / norm(img);
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Representation - Bag of words} \\
First, I extracted features from images and clustered them to build a vocabulary.
For extracting features, I used MATLAB \lstinline{extractHOGFeatures} function.
Instead of extracting at every 20x20 grid points, I used interest points detected by MATLAB \lstinline{detectSURFFeatures}.
\begin{lstlisting}
interest_points = detectSURFFeatures(img, 'MetricThreshold', 100);
interest_points = selectStrongest(interest_points, 200);
[features, ~] = extractHOGFeatures(img, interest_points, 'CellSize', [16 16]);
features_all = cat(1, features_all, features);
\end{lstlisting}
After concatenating the features extracted from each images by above code,
I clustered them as below.
\begin{lstlisting}
[~, vocab] = kmeans(features_all, vocab_size, 'MaxIter', 1000, 'Replicates', 10, 'Start', 'cluster');
\end{lstlisting}
Using the vocabulary built by above procedure, each images can be represented by a bag of words.
I extracted features for each images using the same method described above. 
This could be seen as a redundant procedure, but since we save the vocabulary matrix and do not perform building vocabulary each time,
so actually it is not.
Then, I built a histogram for each images - which is a bag of word reperesentation - using the code below.
The histogram represents the frequency of words in vocabulary that was defined that is closest to the each features extracted from the image.
In order to make this representation reasonable even if the number of detected features differs by images, I applied unit size normalization to the histogram.
\begin{lstlisting}
histogram = zeros(1, vocab_size);
for j = 1 : size(features, 1)
    dist = vocab - features(j, :);
    dist = (vecnorm(dist'))';
    [~, vocab_ind] = min(dist);
    histogram(vocab_ind) = histogram(vocab_ind) + 1;
end
histogram = histogram / norm(histogram);
image_feats(i, :) = histogram;
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Classification - Nearest neighbor} \\
I used voting based on k nearest neighbors, with k set to 5.
For each test image features, I selected k nearest neighbor by below code.
\begin{lstlisting}
diffs = train_image_feats - test_image_feats(i, :);
diffs = vecnorm(diffs');
[~, inds] = mink(diffs, k, 2);
\end{lstlisting}
Then I got the prediction result by voting using function below.
\begin{lstlisting}
function max_label = get_voted_label(inds, train_labels)

k = size(inds, 2);
found_labels = cell(k, 1);
for i = 1 : k
    found_labels{i} = train_labels{inds(i)};
end
votes = zeros(k, 1);
for i = 1 : k
    votes(i) = nnz(strcmp(found_labels{i}, found_labels));
end
[~, vote_ind] = max(votes);
max_label = found_labels{vote_ind};

end
\end{lstlisting}

\textbf{Classification - Support vector machine} \\
In order to make a multi-class SVM, I first trained binary (true or false) SVM for each categories by using the code below.
I didn't tune the \lstinline{Lambda} parameter, since using default lambda gave accuracy higher than 50\%.
\begin{lstlisting}
for i = 1 : num_categories
    binary_vector = strcmp(train_labels, categories(i));
    svm_models{i} = fitclinear(train_image_feats, binary_vector, 'ClassNames', [false true]);
end
\end{lstlisting}
Then, each images are predicted by the binary SVMs of every categories. 
I set the prediction result to be the category that gives the highest score at binary prediction for "true" label.
\begin{lstlisting}
m = size(test_image_feats, 1);
scores_all = zeros(m, num_categories);
for i = 1 : num_categories
    [~, scores_category] = predict(svm_models{i}, test_image_feats);
    scores_all(:, i) = scores_category(:, 2);
end
[~, categories_inds] = max(scores_all, [], 2);
predicted_categories = categories(categories_inds);
\end{lstlisting}
